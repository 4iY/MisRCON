With it you can send commands to a rented server and schedule commands to fire at specific times (like warning the server is restarting, advertising a teamspeak or discord, etc, etc)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is very much just a side project and not in any way an official release from Entrada Interactive. This is just sort of an open source project started by a developer who just happens to work on the game also :)\r\n\r\n## Download\r\nThis is the pre-release. It's rough but it has the basic functionality in. \r\n\r\nhttps://t.co/2WObUCpF7V\r\n\r\n\r\n## More Info\r\nIt's open source and written in Javascript (React/Electron) so anyone can help make it better. It's also nice since you don't need to go to http://miscreatedgame.com/servers to send RCON commands to a rented server. As long as you have internet you can send commands. Which is nice because it means if one goes down it's all good still.\r\n\r\n## Wanna help?\r\nIf you're interested in helping out just fork the repo and send me a pull request or get in touch with me on github. I look forward to any and all code contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Report?\r\nPlease report any issues with the software here: https://github.com/csprance/MisRCON/issues\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![](http://www.csprance.com/shots/2016-12-07_21-55-548aad9111-c619-4d9f-bd07-b20f4c69f248.png)\r\n![](http://www.csprance.com/shots/2016-12-07_21-56-479a7d6332-17b6-4ce7-b7d7-56f2d2dc9ee0.png)\r\n![](http://www.csprance.com/shots/2016-12-07_21-57-27c1506c2f-9f46-411d-b6d2-a2d41c6029d3.png)\r\n![](http://www.csprance.com/shots/2016-12-07_21-57-50a53967dd-f056-4ef0-a54e-78911b75a496.png)\r\n![](http://www.csprance.com/shots/2016-12-07_21-59-10a0066b2c-2e0f-4f4f-a5c3-0315af279b85.png)\r\n![](http://www.csprance.com/shots/2016-12-10_04-40-57aa45abbf-23ed-47c4-8547-d1723a56eae4.png)\r\n![](http://www.csprance.com/shots/2016-12-10_04-41-09a63ed3fc-69ef-4595-a144-c26bb2634aec.png)",
