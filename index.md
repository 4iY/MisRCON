## About
This is an open source RCON tool for Miscreated. With it you can send commands to a rented server and schedule commands to fire at specific times (like warning the server is restarting, advertising a teamspeak or discord, etc, etc)


This is very much just a side project and not in any way an official release from Entrada Interactive. This is just sort of an open source project started by a developer who just happens to work on the game also :)




## More Info
It's open source and written in Javascript (React/Electron) so anyone can help make it better. It's also nice since you don't need to go to http://miscreatedgame.com/servers to send RCON commands to a rented server. As long as you have internet you can send commands. Which is nice because it means if one goes down it's all good still.
